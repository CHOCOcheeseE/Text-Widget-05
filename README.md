## 🌟 Introduction to Flutter & Dart
Flutter is an open-source UI software development kit created by Google. It allows you to build natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. Dart is the programming language used to develop Flutter apps. It’s optimized for building user interfaces and is easy to learn for developers familiar with object-oriented programming.

## 🧩 Basic Flutter Widgets

### 📝 Text Widget
The `Text` widget is one of the most commonly used widgets in Flutter. It allows you to display a string of text with a single style. Here’s how you can customize it:

#### Example:
```dart
Text(
  'Hello, Flutter!',
  style: TextStyle(
    fontSize: 30,
    color: Colors.white,
    fontWeight: FontWeight.bold,
  ),
  textAlign: TextAlign.center,
  overflow: TextOverflow.ellipsis,
  maxLines: 2,
)
```

#### Key Features:
- **`style`**: Customize the text appearance (e.g., font size, color, weight).
- **`textAlign`**: Align the text (e.g., center, left, right).
- **`overflow`**: Handle text overflow (e.g., ellipsis).
- **`maxLines`**: Limit the number of lines.

---

### 📝 StatelessWidget vs StatefulWidget
- **`StatelessWidget`**: A widget that does not require mutable state. It’s immutable and cannot change during runtime.
- **`StatefulWidget`**: A widget that can change its state dynamically. It’s used when the UI needs to update based on user interactions or data changes.

#### Example:
```dart
// StatelessWidget
class MyText extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Text('Hello, Stateless!');
  }
}

// StatefulWidget
class MyCounter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MyCounterState createState() => _MyCounterState();
}

class _MyCounterState extends State<MyCounter> {
  int _counter = 0;

  void _incrementCounter() {
    setState(() {
      _counter++;
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Text('Counter: $_counter');
  }
}
```

## 🎨 Layouts & Design
Flutter provides a variety of layout widgets to structure your UI. Some of the most commonly used ones include:

- **`Container`**: A box model widget that can contain other widgets.
- **`Row` & `Column`**: Arrange widgets horizontally or vertically.
- **`Stack`**: Overlap widgets on top of each other.
- **`ListView`**: Display a scrollable list of widgets.

#### Example:
```dart
Column(
  children: [
    Text('First Item'),
    Text('Second Item'),
    Text('Third Item'),
  ],
)
```

## 🛠️ State Management
State management is crucial for building dynamic apps. Flutter provides several approaches:

- **`setState`**: The simplest way to manage state within a widget.
- **`Provider`**: A more scalable solution for managing state across widgets.
- **`BLoC`**: A pattern that separates business logic from the UI.

#### Example:
```dart
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return ChangeNotifierProvider(
      create: (context) => CounterModel(),
      child: MaterialApp(
        home: CounterScreen(),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

---

## 🚦 Navigation & Routing
Navigation in Flutter is handled using the `Navigator` class. You can navigate between screens using routes.

#### Example:
```dart
Navigator.push(
  context,
  MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => SecondScreen()),
);
```

---

## ⏳ Asynchronous Programming
Dart supports asynchronous programming using `Future`, `async`, and `await`. This is essential for handling tasks like API calls.

#### Example:
```dart
Future<void> fetchData() async {
  final response = await http.get('https://api.example.com/data');
  print(response.body);
}
```
